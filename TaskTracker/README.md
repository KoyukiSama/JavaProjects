here's where I got my project from

when I finish this version I think it'd be cool for me to expand upon it and make it a full on cli program.

thoughts:
okay so while I was sleeping I came to the conclussion that an array list would be better than a linked list for this program (even if yes there won't be a ton of data stored,) I still want to think about this.
Since my frst version closes and reloads with every command an array would be better because, even though it has to copy every time afterwards. the load times are twice as fast since a linked list takes triple the ammount of memory or double. which if reloading the program, has to build twice as much into the program everytime.
if it were a continious application, then yeah, linked list would probably better.
