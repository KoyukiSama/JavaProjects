# JavaProjects
here I'll build java projects on my own


!FINISHED!: first project: task-cli https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

!DELAYED!: second project: apple falling CLI game

!BASE FINISHED!: third (second project) snake game
```
    done completely with CLI
    used maven with JLine library to get proper input handling and to write better to the terminal screen.

    snake was made with a ringbuffer, I learned about ring buffers inside of a data structures class and then some days later I realised that I could make a snake game with a ring buffer for the best performance.
    I'm proud that I could apply that in a project directly.
